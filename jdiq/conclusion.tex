In this paper we introduce \sysName, a crowd-assisted SML-based IE system that can improve the accuracy of its automated results through a crowdsourced workforce.  Our mutual information-based question selection algorithm produces questions with the largest information gain with a given budget.  Probabilistic answer integration can be achieved using a Bayesian formulation that combines multiple, possibly conflicting Turker answers into a single posterior distribution.  We showed a large improvement in cost, speed, and accuracy over random question selection and standard majority voting combination.  

While we focus on text extraction in the paper, we envision a more general Crowd-Assisted Machine Learning (CAMeL)
system that uses a probabilistic database to efficiently connect and integrate crowdsourcing to improve the imperfect results from SML methods. Many of the core elements developed in \sysName such as uncertainty management, question selection, and uncertain data integration are applicable to other SML-based tasks in CAMeL.
